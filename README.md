## WIP - Extra Life Donation Tracker

This is a simple Donation tracker displaying Total amount raised vs your goal. It can be used as a browser source within OBS giving you the freedom to scale as see fit on your OBS scene.

This is free for anyone to use. If you feel so inclined to contribute to my Extra Life page feel free to visit bit.ly/JSStudz. Any little bit helps and keeps me motivated to make more things like this for streamers. Thank you.  

## Instructions:

  Add as browser source to OBS/SLOBS and change as needed.
